# v2 API proposal for swift-aws-lambda-runtime

`swift-aws-lambda-runtime` is an important library for the Swift on Server ecosystem. The initial API was written before
async/await was introduced to Swift. When async/await was introduced, shims were added to bridge between the underlying
SwiftNIO `EventLoop` interfaces and async/await. However, just like `gRPC-swift` and `postgres-nio`, we now want to
shift to solely using async/await instead of `EventLoop` interfaces. For this, large parts of the current API have to be
reconsidered.

## Motivation

### Current Limitations

#### EventLoop interfaces

The current API extensively uses the `EventLoop` family of interfaces from SwiftNIO in many areas. To use these
interfaces correctly though, it requires developers to exercise great care and be aware of certain details such as never
running blocking code on the same `EventLoop` the library uses. Developers also need to understand the various transform
methods that are used to work with `EventLoop`s and `EventLoopFuture`s. This results in a lot of cognitive complexity
and makes the code in the current API hard to reason about and maintain. For these reasons, the overarching trend in the
Swift on Server ecosystem is to shift to newer, more readable, Swift concurrency constructs and de-couple from
SwiftNIO's `EventLoop` interfaces.

#### No ownership of the main() function

A Lambda function can currently be implemented through conformance to the various handler protocols defined in
`AWSLambdaRuntimeCore/LambdaHandler`. Each of these protocols have an extension which implements a `static func main()`.
This allows users to annotate their `LambdaHandler` conforming object with `@main`. The `static func main()` calls the
internal `Lambda.run()` function, which starts the Lambda function. Since the `Lambda.run()` method is internal, users
cannot override the default implementation. This has proven challenging for users who want to
[set up global properties before the Lambda starts-up](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/issues/265).
Setting up global properties is required to customize the Swift Logging, Metric and Tracing backend.

#### Non-trivial transition from SimpleLambdaHandler to LambdaHandler

The `SimpleLambdaHandler` protocol provides a quick and easy way to implement a basic Lambda function. It only requires
an implementation of the `handle` function where the business logic of the Lambda function can be written.
`SimpleLambdaHandler` is perfectly sufficient for small use-cases as the user does not need to spend much time looking
into the library.

However, `SimpleLambdaHandler` cannot be used when services such as a database client need to be initialized before the
Lambda runtime starts and then also gracefully shutdown prior to the runtime terminating. This is because the only way
to register termination logic is through the `LambdaInitializationContext` (containing a field
`terminator: LambdaTerminator`) which is created and used _internally_ within `LambdaRuntime` and never exposed through
`SimpleLambdaHandler`. For such use-cases, other handler protocols like `LambdaHandler` must be used. `LambdaHandler`
exposes a `context` argument of type `LambdaInitializationContext` through its initializer. Within the initializer,
required services can be initialized and their graceful shutdown logic can be registered with the
`context.terminator.register` function.

Yet, `LambdaHandler` is quite cumbersome to use in such use-cases as users have to deviate from the established norms of
the Swift on Server ecosystem in order to cleanly manage the lifecycle of the services intended to be used. This is
because the convenient `swift-service-lifecycle` v2 library — which is commonly used for cleanly managing the lifecycles
of required services and widely supported by many libraries — cannot be used in a structured concurrency manner.

#### Does not integrate well with swift-service-lifecycle in a structured concurrency manner

The Lambda runtime can only be started using the **internal** `Lambda.run()` function. This function is called by the
`main()` function defined by the `LambdaHandler` protocol, preventing users from injecting initialized services into the
runtime _prior_ to it starting. As shown below, this forces users to use an **unstructured concurrency** approach and
manually initialize services, leading to the issue of the user then perhaps forgetting to gracefully shutdown the
initialized services:

```swift
struct MyLambda: LambdaHandler {
    let pgClient: PostgresClient

    init(context: AWSLambdaRuntimeCore.LambdaInitializationContext) async throws {
        /// Instantiate service
        let client = PostgresClient(configuration: ...)

        /// Unstructured concurrency to initialize the service
        let pgTask = Task {
            await client.run()
        }

        /// Store the client in `self` so that it can be used in `handle(...)`
        self.pgClient = client

        /// !!! Must remember to explicitly register termination logic for PostgresClient !!!
        context.terminator.register(
           name: "PostgreSQL Client",
           handler: { eventLoop in
               pgTask.cancel()
               return eventLoop.makeFutureWithTask {
                  await pgTask.value
               }
           }
        )
    }

    func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output {
        /// Use the initialized service stored in `self.pgClient`
        try await self.pgClient.query(...)
    }
}
```

#### Verbose Codable support

In the current API, there are extensions and Codable wrapper classes for decoding events and encoding computed responses
for _each_ different handler protocol and for both `String` and `JSON` formats. This has resulted in a lot of
boilerplate code which can very easily be made generic and simplified in v2.

### New features

#### Support response streaming

In April 2023
[AWS introduced support for response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/)
in Lambda. The current API does not support streaming. For v2 we want to change this.

#### Scheduling background work

In May
[AWS described in a blog post that you can run background tasks in Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-code-after-returning-a-response-from-an-aws-lambda-function/)
until the runtime asks for more work from the control plane. We want to support this by adding new API that allows
background processing, even after the response has been returned.

## Proposed Solution

### async/await-first API

Large parts of `Lambda`, `LambdaHandler`, and `LambdaRuntime` will be re-written to use async/await constructs in place
of the `EventLoop` family of interfaces.

### Providing ownership of main() and support for swift-service-lifecycle

- Instead of conforming to a handler protocol, users can now create a `LambdaRuntime` by passing in a handler closure.
- `LambdaRuntime` conforms to `ServiceLifecycle.Service` by implementing a `run()` method that contains initialization
  and graceful shutdown logic.
- This allows the lifecycle of the `LambdaRuntime` to be managed with `swift-service-lifecycle` _alongside_ and in the
  same way the lifecycles of the required services are managed, e.g.
  `try await ServiceGroup(services: [postgresClient, ..., lambdaRuntime], ...).run()`.
- Dependencies can now be injected into `LambdaRuntime` — `swift-service-lifecycle` guarantees that the services will be
  initialized _before_ the `LambdaRuntime`'s `run()` function is called.
- The required services can then be used within the handler in a structured concurrency manner.
  `swift-service-lifecycle` takes care of listening for termination signals and terminating the services as well as the
  `LambdaRuntime` in correct order.
- `LambdaTerminator` can now be eliminated because its role is replaced with `swift-service-lifecycle`. The termination
  logic of the Lambda function will be implemented in the conforming `run()` function of `LambdaRuntime`.

With this, the earlier code snippet can be replaced with something much easier to read, maintain, and debug:

```swift
/// Instantiate services
let postgresClient = PostgresClient()

/// Instantiate LambdaRuntime with a closure handler implementing the business logic of the Lambda function
let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
    /// Use initialized service within the handler
    try await postgresClient.query(...)
}

/// Use ServiceLifecycle to manage the initialization and termination
/// of the services as well as the LambdaRuntime
let serviceGroup = ServiceGroup(
    services: [postgresClient, runtime],
    configuration: .init(gracefulShutdownSignals: [.sigterm]),
    logger: logger
)
try await serviceGroup.run()
```

### Simplifying Codable support

A detailed explanation is provided in the **Codable Support** section. In short, much of the boilerplate code defined for
each handler protocol in `Lambda+Codable` and `Lambda+String` will be replaced with a single `LambdaCodableAdapter`
struct.

This adapter struct is generic over (1) any handler conforming to `LambdaHandler`, (2) the user-specified input and
output types, and (3) any decoder and encoder conforming to `LambdaEventDecoder` and `LambdaOutputDecoder`. The adapter
will wrap the underlying handler with encoding/decoding logic.

### Simplifying the handler protocols

There are four different handler protocols in the current API (`SimpleLambdaHandler`, `LambdaHandler`,
`EventLoopLambdaHandler`, `ByteBufferLambdaHandler`). As noted in the **Current Limitations** section, the ease-of-use
varies for each handler protocol and users may not be able to easily determine which protocol best serves their use-case
without spending time digging into the library. To reduce this problem and provide users with clear-cut options, we
propose replacing all of the existing handler protocols with just two: `LambdaHandler` and `StreamingLambdaHandler`.
Both will be explained in the **Detailed Solution** section.

## Detailed Solution

Below are explanations for all types that we want to use in AWS Lambda Runtime v2.

### LambdaResponseWriter

We will introduce a new `LambdaResponseWriter` protocol. It is used in the new `StreamingLambdaHandler` (defined below),
which is the new base protocol for the `LambdaRuntime` (defined below as well).

```swift
/// A writer object to write the Lambda response stream into
public protocol LambdaResponseWriter: ~Copyable {
    /// Write a response part into the stream
    func write(_ buffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
    /// End the response stream
    consuming func finish()
    /// Write a response part into the stream and end the response stream
    consuming func writeAndFinish(_ buffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
    /// Report an error in the response stream
    consuming func reportError(_ error: any Error) async throws
}
```

### LambdaContext

`LambdaContext` will be largely unchanged, but the `eventLoop` property as well as the `allocator` property (of type
`ByteBufferAllocator`) will be removed.

A new function `addBackgroundTask(_:)` will also be added. This will allow tasks to be run in the background while and after
the response is/has been sent. Please note that `LambdaContext` will not be `Sendable` anymore, because in order
to allow adding background tasks in a structured way, the `LambdaContext` will need to be backed with a `TaskGroup`.
Since `TaskGroup` is not `Sendable` we cannot mark `LambdaContext` as `Sendable`. If users need any property out of the
`LambdaContext` they can just extract the property and then pass it around or close over it as all the properties are
`Sendable`.

```swift
/// A context object passed as part of an invocation in LambdaHandler handle functions.
public struct LambdaContext {
    /// The request ID, which identifies the request that triggered the function invocation.
    public var requestID: String { get }

    /// The AWS X-Ray tracing header.
    public var traceID: String { get }

    /// The ARN of the Lambda function, version, or alias that's specified in the invocation.
    public var invokedFunctionARN: String { get }

    /// The timestamp that the function times out.
    public var deadline: DispatchWallTime { get }

    /// For invocations from the AWS Mobile SDK, data about the Amazon Cognito identity provider.
    public var cognitoIdentity: String? { get }

    /// For invocations from the AWS Mobile SDK, data about the client application and device.
    public var clientContext: String? { get }

    /// `Logger` to log with.
    ///
    /// - note: The `LogLevel` can be configured using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
    public var logger: Logger { get }

    /// Schedule background work in lambda. This work must be completed before
    /// the runtime can ask for further events. Note that AWS will continue to
    /// charge you after the response has been returned, but work is still
    /// processing in the background.
    public func addBackgroundTask(_ body: sending @escaping () async -> ())
}
```

### StreamingLambdaHandler

The new `StreamingLambdaHandler` protocol is the base protocol to implement a Lambda function. Most users will not use
this protocol and instead use the `LambdaHandler` protocol defined in the **Codable Support** section.

```swift
/// The base StreamingLambdaHandler protocol
public protocol StreamingLambdaHandler: ~Copyable {
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - event: The invocation's input data
    ///   - responseWriter: A ``LambdaResponseWriter`` to write the invocations response to.
    ///                     If no response or error is written to the `responseWriter` it will
    ///                     report an error to the invoker.
    ///   - context: The LambdaContext containing the invocation's metadata
    mutating func handle(_ event: ByteBuffer, responseWriter: consuming some LambdaResponseWriter, context: LambdaContext) async
}
```

The protocol is defined in a way that supports a broad range of use-cases. The handle method is marked as `mutating` to
allow handlers to be implemented with a `struct`. Users can opt to even mark the handler as non-copyable.

An implementation that sends the number 1 to 10 every 500ms could look like this:

```swift
struct SendNumbersWithPause: StreamingLambdaHandler {
    func handle(
        _ event: ByteBuffer,
        responseWriter: consuming some LambdaResponseWriter,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async {
        for i in 1...10 {
            responseWriter.write(ByteBuffer(string: #"\#(i)\n\r"#))
            try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(500))
        }
        responseWriter.finish()
    }
}
```

The method is not marked as `throws` as we want the users of this API to handle errors themselves and call
`LambdaResponseWriter.reportError(_:)` if needed.

### LambdaRuntime

`LambdaRuntime` is the class that communicates with the Lambda control plane as defined in
[Building a custom runtime for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) and
forward the invocations to the provided `StreamingLambdaHandler`. It will conform to `ServiceLifecycle.Service` to
provide support for `swift-service-lifecycle`.

```swift
/// The LambdaRuntime object. This object communicates with the Lambda control plane
/// to fetch work and report errors.
public final class LambdaRuntime<Handler>: ServiceLifecycle.Service, Sendable
    where Handler: StreamingLambdaHandler, Handler: ~Copyable
{

    /// Create a LambdaRuntime by passing a handler, an eventLoop and a logger.
    /// - Parameter handler: A ``StreamingLambdaHandler`` that will be invoked
    /// - Parameter eventLoop: An ``EventLoop`` on which the LambdaRuntime will be
    ///                        executed. Defaults to an EventLoop from
    ///                        ``NIOSingletons.posixEventLoopGroup``.
    /// - Parameter logger: A logger
    public init(
        handler: consuming sending Handler,
        eventLoop: EventLoop = Lambda.defaultEventLoop,
        logger: Logger = Logger(label: "Lambda")
    )

    /// Create a LambdaRuntime by passing a ``StreamingLambdaHandler``.
    public convenience init(handler: consuming sending Handler)

    /// Starts the LambdaRuntime by connecting to the Lambda control plane to ask
    /// for events to process. If the environment variable AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API is
    /// set, the LambdaRuntime will connect to the Lambda control plane. Otherwise
    /// it will start a mock server that can be used for testing at port 8080
    /// locally.
    /// Cancel the task that runs this function to close the communication with
    /// the Lambda control plane or close the local mock server. This function
    /// only returns once cancelled.
    public func run() async throws
}
```

The current API allows for a Lambda function to be tested locally through a mock server by requiring an environment
variable named `LOCAL_LAMBDA_SERVER_ENABLED` to be set to `true`. If this environment variable is not set, the program
immediately crashes as the user will not have the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable on their local machine
(set automatically when deployed to AWS Lambda). However, making the user set the `LOCAL_LAMBDA_SERVER_ENABLED`
environment variable is an unnecessary step that can be avoided. In the v2 API, the `run()` function will automatically
start the mock server when the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable cannot be found.

### Lambda

We also add an enum to store a static function and a property on. We put this on the static `Lambda` because
`LambdaRuntime` is generic and thus has bad ergonomics for static properties and functions.

```swift
enum Lambda {
    /// This returns the default EventLoop that a LambdaRuntime is scheduled on.
    /// It uses `NIOSingletons.posixEventLoopGroup.next()` under the hood.
    public static var defaultEventLoop: any EventLoop { get }

    /// Report a startup error to the Lambda Control Plane API
    public static func reportStartupError(any Error) async
}
```

Since the library now provides ownership of the `main()` function and allows users to initialize services before the
`LambdaRuntime` is initialized, the library cannot implicitly report
[errors that occur during initialization to the dedicated endpoint AWS exposes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html#runtimes-api-initerror)
like it currently does through the `initialize()` function of `LambdaRunner` which wraps the handler's `init(...)` and
handles any errors thrown by reporting it to the dedicated AWS endpoint.

To retain support for initialization error reporting, the `Lambda.reportStartupError(any Error)` function gives users
the option to manually report initialization errors in their closure handler. Although this should ideally happen
implicitly like it currently does in v1, we believe this is a small compromise in comparison to the benefits gained in
now being able to cleanly manage the lifecycles of required services in a structured concurrency manner.

> Use-case:
>
> Assume we want to load a secret for the Lambda function from a secret vault first. If this fails, we want to report
> the error to the control plane:
>
> ```swift
> let secretVault = SecretVault()
>
> do {
>    /// !!! Error thrown: secret "foo" does not exist !!!
>    let secret = try await secretVault.getSecret("foo")
>
>    let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
>        /// Lambda business logic
>    }
>
>    let serviceGroup = ServiceGroup(
>        services: [postgresClient, runtime],
>        configuration: .init(gracefulShutdownSignals: [.sigterm]),
>        logger: logger
>    )
>    try await serviceGroup.run()
> } catch {
>    /// Report startup error straight away to the dedicated initialization error endpoint
>    try await Lambda.reportStartupError(error)
> }
> ```

### Codable support

For v2 we want to introduce a `LambdaCodableAdapter` that:

1. Accepts any generic underlying handler conforming to a new protocol `LambdaHandler` specifying `associatedtype`s
   `Event` and `Output`, and a `handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output` function.

#### LambdaHandler

```swift
public protocol LambdaHandler {
    /// Generic input type
    /// The body of the request sent to Lambda will be decoded into this type for the handler to consume
    associatedtype Event
    /// Generic output type
    /// This is the return type of the handle() function.
    associatedtype Output

    /// The business logic of the Lambda function. Receives a generic input type and returns a generic output type.
    /// Agnostic to JSON encoding/decoding
    mutating func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
}
```

2. Accepts _any_ encoder and decoder object conforming to the `LambdaEventDecoder` and `LambdaOutputEncoder` protocols:

#### LambdaEventDecoder and LambdaOutputEncoder protocols

```swift
public protocol LambdaEventDecoder {
    /// Decode the ByteBuffer representing the received event into the generic type Event
    /// the handler will receive
    func decode<Event: Decodable>(_ type: Event.Type, from buffer: ByteBuffer) throws -> Event
}

public protocol LambdaOutputEncoder {
    /// Encode the generic type Output the handler has produced into a ByteBuffer
    func encode<Output: Encodable>(_ value: Output, into buffer: inout ByteBuffer) throws
}
```

We provide conformances for Foundation's `JSONDecoder` to `LambdaEventDecoder` and `JSONEncoder` to
`LambdaOutputEncoder`.

3. Implements its `handle()` method by:
   1. Decoding the `ByteBuffer` event into the generic `Event` type.
   2. Passing the generic `Event` instance to the underlying handler's `handle()` method.
   3. Encoding the generic `Output` returned from the underlying `handle()` into JSON and returning it.

#### LambdaCodableAdapter

`LambdaCodableAdapter` can implement encoding/decoding for _any_ handler conforming to `LambdaHandler` if `Event` is
`Decodable` and the `Output` is `Encodable`, meaning that the encoding/decoding stubs do not need to be implemented by
the user.

```swift
/// Wraps an underlying handler conforming to `LambdaHandler`
/// with encoding/decoding logic
public struct LambdaCodableAdapter<
    Handler: LambdaHandler,
    Event: Decodable,
    Output,
    Decoder: LambdaEventDecoder,
    Encoder: LambdaOutputEncoder
>: StreamingLambdaHandler where Handler.Output == Output, Handler.Event == Event {

    /// Register the concrete handler, encoder, and decoder.
    public init(
        handler: Handler,
        encoder: Encoder,
        decoder: Decoder
    ) where Output: Encodable

    /// For handler with a void output -- the user doesn't specify an encoder.
    public init(
        handler: Handler,
        decoder: Decoder
    ) where Output == Void, Encoder == VoidEncoder

    /// 1. Decode the invocation event using `self.decoder`
    /// 2. Call the underlying `self.handler.handle()`
    ///    method with the decoded event data.
    /// 3. Return the encoded output of (2) with `self.encoder`
    public mutating func handle(
        _ request: ByteBuffer,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws -> LambdaResponse
}
```

### Handler as a Closure

To create a Lambda function using the current API, a user first has to create an object and conform it to one of the
handler protocols by implementing the initializer and the `handle(...)` function. Now that `LambdaRuntime` is public,
this verbosity can very easily be simplified.

#### ClosureHandler

This handler is generic over any `Event` type conforming to `Decodable` and any `Output` type conforming to `Encodable`
or `Void`.

```swift
public struct ClosureHandler<Event, Output>: LambdaHandler {
    /// Initialize with a closure handler over generic Input and Output types
    public init(body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Output) where Output: Encodable
    /// Initialize with a closure handler over a generic Input type (Void Output).
    public init(body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Void) where Output == Void
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function.
    public func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
}
```

Given that `ClosureHandler` conforms to `LambdaHandler`:

1. We can extend the `LambdaRuntime` initializer such that it accepts a closure as an argument.
2. Within the initializer, the closure handler is wrapped with `LambdaCodableAdapter`.

```swift
extension LambdaRuntime {
    /// Initialize a LambdaRuntime with a closure handler over generic Event and Output types.
    /// This initializer bolts on encoding/decoding logic by wrapping the closure handler with
    /// LambdaCodableAdapter.
    public init<Event: Decodable, Output: Encodable>(
        body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
    ) where Handler == LambdaCodableAdapter<ClosureHandler<Event, Output>, Event, Output, JSONDecoder, JSONEncoder>

    /// Same as above but for handlers with a void output
    public init<Event: Decodable>(
        body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Void
    ) where Handler == LambdaCodableAdapter<ClosureHandler<Event, Void>, Event, Void, JSONDecoder, VoidEncoder>
}
```

We can now significantly reduce the verbosity and leverage Swift's trailing closure syntax to cleanly create and run a
Lambda function, abstracting away the decoding and encoding logic from the user:

```swift
/// The type the handler will use as input
struct Input: Decodable {
    var message: String
}

/// The type the handler will output
struct Greeting: Encodable {
    var echoedMessage: String
}

/// A simple Lambda function that echoes the input
let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
    Greeting(echoedMessage: event.message)
}

try await runtime.run()
```

We also add a `StreamingClosureHandler` conforming to `StreamingLambdaHandler` for use-cases where the user wants to
handle encoding/decoding themselves:

```swift
public struct StreamingClosureHandler: StreamingLambdaHandler {

    public init(
        body: @escaping sending (ByteBuffer, consuming LambdaResponseWriter, LambdaContext) async -> ()
    )

    public func handle(
        _ request: ByteBuffer,
        responseWriter: consuming LambdaResponseWriter,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async
}

extension LambdaRuntime {
    public init(
        body: @escaping sending (ByteBuffer, consuming LambdaResponseWriter, LambdaContext) async -> ()
    )
}
```

## Alternatives considered

### [UInt8] instead of ByteBuffer

We considered using `[UInt8]` instead of `ByteBuffer` in the base `LambdaHandler` API. We decided to use `ByteBuffer`
for two reasons.

1. 99% of use-cases will use the JSON codable API and will not directly get in touch with ByteBuffer anyway. For those
   users it does not matter if the base API uses `ByteBuffer` or `[UInt8]`.
2. The incoming and outgoing data must be in the `ByteBuffer` format anyway, as Lambda uses SwiftNIO under the hood and
   SwiftNIO uses `ByteBuffer` in its APIs. By using `ByteBuffer` we can save a copies to and from `[UInt8]`. This will
   reduce the invocation time for all users.
3. The base `LambdaHandler` API is most likely mainly being used by developers that want to integrate their web
   framework with Lambda (examples: Vapor, Hummingbird, ...). Those developers will most likely prefer to get the data
   in the `ByteBuffer` format anyway, as their lower level networking stack also depends on SwiftNIO.

### Users create a LambdaResponse, that supports streaming instead of being passed a LambdaResponseWriter

Instead of passing the `LambdaResponseWriter` in the invocation we considered a new type `LambdaResponse`, that users
must return in the `StreamingLambdaHandler`.

Its API would look like this:

```swift
/// A response returned from a ``LambdaHandler``.
/// The response can be empty, a single ByteBuffer or a response stream.
public struct LambdaResponse {
    /// A writer to be used when creating a streamed response.
    public struct Writer: ~Copyable {
        /// Writes data to the response stream
        public func write(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
        /// Closes off the response stream
        public func finish() async throws
        /// Writes the `byteBuffer` to the response stream and subsequently closes the stream
        public func writeAndFinish(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
    }

    /// Creates an empty lambda response
    public init()

    /// Creates a LambdaResponse with a fixed ByteBuffer.
    public init(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer)

    /// Creates a streamed lambda response. Use the ``Writer`` to send
    /// response chunks on the stream.
    public init(_ stream: @escaping sending (Writer) async throws -> ())
}
```

The `StreamingLambdaHandler` would look like this:

```swift
/// The base LambdaHandler protocol
public protocol StreamingLambdaHandler: ~Copyable {
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - event: The invocation's input data
    ///   - context: The LambdaContext containing the invocation's metadata
    /// - Returns: A LambdaResponse, that can be streamed
    mutating func handle(
        _ event: ByteBuffer,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws -> LambdaResponse
}
```

There are pros and cons for the API that returns the `LambdaResponses` and there are pros and cons for the API that
receives a `LambdaResponseWriter` as a parameter.

Concerning following structured concurrency principles the approach that receives a `LambdaResponseWriter` as a
parameter has benefits as the lifetime of the handle function is tied to the invocation runtime. The approach that
returns a `LambdaResponse` splits the invocation into two separate function calls. First the handle method is invoked,
second the `LambdaResponse` writer closure is invoked. This means that it is impossible to use Swift APIs that use
`with` style lifecycle management patterns from before creating the response until sending the full response stream off.
For example, users instrumenting their lambdas with Swift tracing likely can not use the `withSpan` API for the full
lifetime of the request, if they return a streamed response.

However, if it comes to consistency with the larger Swift on server ecosystem, the API that returns a `LambdaResponse`
is likely the better choice. Hummingbird v2, OpenAPI and the new Swift gRPC v2 implementation all use this approach.
This might be due to the fact that writing middleware becomes easier, if a Response is explicitly returned.

We decided to implement the approach in which a `LambdaResponseWriter` is passed to the function, since the approach in
which a `LambdaResponse` is returned can trivially be built on top of it. This is not true vice versa.

We welcome the discussion on this topic and are open to change our minds and API here.

## A word about versioning

We are aware that AWS Lambda Runtime has not reached a proper 1.0. We intend to keep the current implementation around
at 1.0-alpha. We don't want to change the current API without releasing a new major. We think there are lots of adopters
out there that depend on the API in v1. Because of this we intend to release the proposed API here as AWS Lambda Runtime
v2.
